# mtg-deck-builder

* This is a very useful framework, as it doesn't use any servers.  Uses gdocs for the database, a free api on blockspring and of github pages to host. Costs $0.00. *

*Hope to implement a login system that bypasses the need for a database.  Think this can be accomplished by javascript. I'm a noob, so idk.*

*Credit to Donpinkus, as most of this is fork from his repository.  I'm just making some modifications*
